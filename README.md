## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Utilize Masks for Precise Edge Detection ðŸš¨

get_edges.py 

This file generates (2 * 2), (3 * 3), and (5 * 5) edges respectively using mask images.
When running one of them, you need to comment out the rest. After modifying the directory, you can run it directly to generate the corresponding edges images



## Dataset

To apply the model to a custom dataset, the data tree should be constructed as:
``` 
    â”œâ”€â”€ dataset
          â”œâ”€â”€ images
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_1.png
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_2.png
                .......
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_n.png
          â”œâ”€â”€ masks
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_1.png
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_2.png
                .......
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_n.png
          â”œâ”€â”€ edges
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_1.png
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_2.png
                .......
                â”œâ”€â”€ image_n.png
```




## ðŸ’¡ Train
 just  run trian.py 

Before training ,make sure you change the parameter following: train_path, train_save, epoch, batchsize, trainsize(it is better not to change it)ï¼Œand backbone.



## ðŸ’¡ Test
Test the image using the .pth weights from the training.

Before running the test.py, make sure to change the parameters data_path, pth_path,save_path and testize (it os better not to change it).
